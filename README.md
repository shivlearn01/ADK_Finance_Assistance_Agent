---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Tutorial

We'll build this project in three progressive steps, each adding new capabilities to our finance assistant.

---

### Step 1: Basic Finance Assistant (No Tools)

In this first step, we'll create a simple finance assistant that can answer generic finance questions without any external tools.

#### 📁 Create the Project Structure

```
ADK_Finance_Assistance_Agent/
├── finance_assistant_agent/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py
└── requirements.txt
```

#### 💻 Code Implementation

**File: `finance_assistant_agent/__init__.py`**

```python
from . import agent
```

**File: `finance_assistant_agent/agent.py`**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

finance_assistance_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="finance_assistance_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="A simple finance assistant that helps with user's finance goals.",
    instruction="""You are a friendly finance assistant. 
        You can help answer user's generic questions on finance and help plan
        their finance goals. Be more friendly and positive.
    """,
    tools=[]  # No tools yet!
)

root_agent = finance_assistance_agent
```

#### 🔍 Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each part does:

1. **`LlmAgent`**: This is the core class from Google ADK that creates an AI agent powered by a Large Language Model.

2. **`name`**: A unique identifier for your agent. This helps when you have multiple agents.

3. **`model`**: Specifies which Gemini model to use. We're using `gemini-2.5-flash` which is fast and efficient.

4. **`description`**: A brief explanation of what this agent does. This is useful when other agents need to call this agent.

5. **`instruction`**: Detailed instructions that guide the agent's behavior. Think of this as the agent's "personality" and "job description."

6. **`tools=[]`**: An empty list because we haven't added any tools yet.

7. **`root_agent`**: ADK looks for this variable to know which agent to run first.

#### 🧪 Testing Step 1

Run the agent using ADK's web interface:

```bash
adk web
```

Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8000`).

**Example Interaction:**

**User:** "Explain Recurring Deposit"

**Agent Response:** 
> "A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a type of term deposit offered by banks and financial institutions. It allows you to deposit a fixed amount of money regularly (monthly, quarterly, etc.) for a predetermined period. At the end of the tenure, you receive the maturity amount which includes your principal deposits plus the interest earned.
>
> Key Features:
> - Fixed monthly installments
> - Higher interest rates than savings accounts
> - Flexible tenure options (6 months to 10 years)
> - Good for building savings discipline
> - Premature withdrawal options available with penalties"

✅ **Step 1 Complete!** Your agent can now answer general finance questions using its built-in knowledge.

---

### Step 2: Adding Custom Tools

Now let's enhance our agent by adding a custom tool that provides the user's personal finance details. This allows the agent to give personalized advice.

#### 💻 Updated Code

**File: `finance_assistant_agent/agent.py`**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from typing import Dict

def get_user_personal_finance_details() -> Dict:
    """
    Gets users personal finance details like salary, expense and savings capacity.
    """
    return {
        "salary": 50000,
        "expense": {
            "EMI_Expense": 25000,
            "Essentials": 5000,
            "Entertainment": 5000,
            "Shopping and Travel": 5000
        },
        "savings": 10000
    }

finance_assistance_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="finance_assistance_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="A simple finance assistant that helps with user's finance goals.",
    instruction="""You are a friendly finance assistant. 
        You can help answer user's generic questions on finance and help plan
        their finance goals. Be more friendly and positive.

        You have a tool called get_user_personal_finance_details which will 
        give you the user's current finance details.
    """,
    tools=[get_user_personal_finance_details]  # Tool added!
)

root_agent = finance_assistance_agent
```

#### 🔍 Understanding the Custom Tool

1. **Function Definition**: We create a Python function `get_user_personal_finance_details()` that returns a dictionary with the user's financial information.

2. **Type Hints**: `-> Dict` indicates this function returns a dictionary. This helps ADK understand the tool better.

3. **Docstring**: The triple-quoted string under the function name is crucial! ADK uses this to understand when and how to use the tool.

4. **Return Value**: We return a structured dictionary with:
   - `salary`: Monthly income (₹50,000)
   - `expense`: Breakdown of different expense categories
   - `savings`: Current monthly savings (₹10,000)

5. **Tools List**: We pass the function to the `tools` parameter. ADK automatically converts it into a tool the agent can use.

#### 🧪 Testing Step 2

Restart the ADK web interface:

```bash
adk web
```

**Example Interaction:**

**User:** "Can you analyse my financial details and suggest how to save 15000 per month"

**Agent Response:**
> "Let me check your current financial situation...
>
> Based on your details:
> - **Monthly Salary**: ₹50,000
> - **Current Expenses**: ₹40,000
>   - EMI: ₹25,000
>   - Essentials: ₹5,000
>   - Entertainment: ₹5,000
>   - Shopping & Travel: ₹5,000
> - **Current Savings**: ₹10,000
>
> To save ₹15,000 per month (an additional ₹5,000), here are my suggestions:
>
> 1. **Reduce Entertainment Spending**: Cut down from ₹5,000 to ₹3,000 (Save ₹2,000)
> 2. **Optimize Shopping & Travel**: Reduce from ₹5,000 to ₹3,000 (Save ₹2,000)
> 3. **Find Additional Income**: Consider a side hustle for extra ₹1,000
>
> This way, you can achieve your goal of saving ₹15,000 monthly while maintaining essential expenses!"

✅ **Step 2 Complete!** Your agent can now access user data and provide personalized financial advice.

---

### Step 3: Multi-Agent Setup

In this final step, we'll add a second agent that can search the internet for real-time information like current FD interest rates. The two agents will work together to provide comprehensive financial planning.

```

#### 💻 Code Implementation

**File: `investment_plan_agent/__Init__.py`**

```python
from . import agent
```

**File: `investment_plan_agent/agent.py`**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

investment_plan_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="investment_plan_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description=" An investment plan assistant who can use Google Search to find latest information " \
    "and assist users in creating a savings plan",
    instruction="""You are a friendly finance assistant. 
        You can help analyse user's monthly spending and find out ways to 
        reduce spending and increase savings to achieve their goal.

        ALWAYS use the google_search tool when asked about:
        - Stock prices (e.g., "Tesla stock price", "TSLA latest price")
        - Market data, financial news, or company information
        - ANY question containing words like "latest", "current", "today", "now", "recent"

        After searching, provide the factual data from the search results with specific numbers and sources.
    """,
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

**File: `finance_assistant_agent/agent.py` (Updated)**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from typing import Dict
from google.adk.tools.agent_tool import AgentTool
from investment_plan_agent.agent import investment_plan_agent

def get_user_personal_finance_details() -> Dict:
    """
    Gets users personal finance details like salary, expense and savings capacity.
    """
    return {
        "salary": 50000,
        "expense": {
            "EMI_Expense": 25000,
            "Essentials": 5000,
            "Entertainment": 5000,
            "Shopping and Travel": 5000
        },
        "savings": 10000
    }

finance_assistance_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="finance_assistance_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="A simple finance assistant that helps with user's finance goals.",
    instruction="""You are a friendly finance assistant. 
        You can help answer user's generic questions on finance and help plan
        their finance goals. Be more friendly and positive.

        You have two tools to use to complete your task.
        1. get_user_personal_finance_details - This tool will give you the user's current finance details
        2. investment_plan_agent - This tool can perform Google Search to get any 
        latest information from websites and will be able to ask more details
        from the user and plan their savings goal.

        ALWAYS use the investment_plan_agent with google_search tool when asked about:
        - Stock prices (e.g., "Tesla stock price", "TSLA latest price")
        - Market data, financial news, or company information
        - ANY question containing words like "latest", "current", "today", "now", "recent"    
    """,
    tools=[AgentTool(investment_plan_agent), get_user_personal_finance_details]
)

root_agent = finance_assistance_agent
```

#### 🔍 Understanding Multi-Agent Architecture

Let's understand how the agents work together:

1. **Investment Plan Agent**:
   - Specialized agent focused on investment planning
   - Has access to `google_search` tool for real-time data
   - Can search for current FD rates, stock prices, etc.

2. **AgentTool Wrapper**:
   ```python
   AgentTool(investment_plan_agent)
   ```
   This wraps another agent as a tool, allowing the main agent to delegate tasks to it.

3. **Agent Collaboration**:
   - Main agent (`finance_assistance_agent`) receives the user query
   - It uses `get_user_personal_finance_details()` to get personal data
   - It calls `investment_plan_agent` (via `AgentTool`) for market research
   - Investment agent uses `google_search` to find current FD rates
   - Results flow back to the main agent
   - Main agent combines all information and responds to the user

4. **Clear Instructions**:
   Both agents have clear instructions about when to use their tools, preventing confusion and ensuring efficient task delegation.

#### 🧪 Testing Step 3

Restart ADK web interface:

```bash
adk web
```

**Example Interaction:**

**User:** "Can you analyse my financial details and suggest how to save 15000 per month and also check the current FD interest rates for SBI and tell me if I invest this 15000 Rupees in FD every month can I achieve 1000000 in 3 years?"

**Agent Response:**
> "Let me analyze your situation comprehensively...
>
> **Your Current Financial Situation:**
> - Monthly Salary: ₹50,000
> - Current Savings: ₹10,000
> - Total Expenses: ₹40,000
>
> **Expense Breakdown:**
> - EMI: ₹25,000
> - Essentials: ₹5,000
> - Entertainment: ₹5,000
> - Shopping & Travel: ₹5,000
>
> **To Save ₹15,000 per month:**
> 1. Reduce Entertainment: ₹5,000 → ₹3,000 (Save ₹2,000)
> 2. Cut Shopping & Travel: ₹5,000 → ₹3,000 (Save ₹2,000)
> 3. Optimize Essentials: ₹5,000 → ₹4,000 (Save ₹1,000)
>
> **Current SBI FD Rates** (as per latest search):
> - For 3-year tenure: Approximately 6.5% - 7.0% per annum
> - Senior Citizens: 7.0% - 7.5% per annum
>
> **Investment Calculation:**
> If you invest ₹15,000 every month in an SBI FD at 7% annual interest:
> - Monthly Investment: ₹15,000
> - Duration: 36 months (3 years)
> - Total Principal: ₹5,40,000
> - Estimated Interest: ~₹60,000 - ₹70,000
> - **Maturity Amount: ~₹6,00,000 - ₹6,10,000**
>
> **Conclusion:**
> Unfortunately, with ₹15,000 monthly investment in FD at current rates, you'll reach approximately ₹6 lakhs in 3 years, which is short of your ₹10 lakh goal.
>
> **Alternative Suggestions:**
> 1. Increase monthly investment to ₹25,000 if possible
> 2. Consider higher-return options like mutual funds (market-linked)
> 3. Extend the investment period to 5-6 years
> 4. Combine FD with equity investments for better returns"

✅ **Step 3 Complete!** You now have a multi-agent system that provides comprehensive financial planning with real-time market data!

An AI agent powered by a Large Language Model (like Gemini) that can understand natural language, make decisions, and use tools to accomplish tasks.

### 2. **Tools**
Functions or capabilities that an agent can use to perform specific tasks:
- **Custom Functions**: Python functions you write (like `get_user_personal_finance_details`)
- **Built-in Tools**: Provided by ADK (like `google_search`)
- **Agent Tools**: Other agents wrapped as tools for delegation

### 3. **Multi-Agent System**
Multiple specialized agents working together, each handling specific aspects of a larger task. Benefits include:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Ability to specialize agents for specific tasks
- Scalable architecture

### 4. **Instructions**
Clear directions given to agents about their role, capabilities, and when to use specific tools. Good instructions lead to better agent performance.

### 5. **Root Agent**
The entry point of your application. ADK looks for the `root_agent` variable to know which agent to initialize first.
